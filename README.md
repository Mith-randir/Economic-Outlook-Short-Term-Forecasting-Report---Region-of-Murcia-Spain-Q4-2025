## Assignment tasks

This repository documents my final coursework project for the **Coyuntura y Predicción** class (Universidad Pablo de Olavide, UPO).  
The goal was to produce a concise, policy‑oriented **quarterly economic outlook report** for an assigned Spanish Autonomous Community (here: **Region of Murcia**), including a comparison with Spain and short‑term forecasts.

### Required report structure

- **1) Executive summary (Resumen)**
  - Provide a short, attractive overview of the regional economy.
  - Visualize and summarize the main indicators.
  - Identify and justify the current phase of the business cycle and the short‑term outlook.

- **2) Productive activity (Actividad productiva)**
  - Analyze regional GDP and other activity indicators (e.g., Industrial Production Index and Business Confidence).
  - Add any other relevant indicators available for the region.

- **3) Demand (Demanda)**
  - Use available demand indicators for the region.
  - Analyze the external sector: exports, imports, and trade balance.

- **4) Labour market (Mercado de trabajo)**
  - Analyze activity, employment and unemployment (EPA), Social Security affiliations, and registered unemployment.
  - Optionally include other relevant labour market indicators.

- **5) Prices and costs (Precios y costes)**
  - Analyze inflation (headline CPI and core CPI).
  - Analyze labour costs (wages and other labour costs).

- **6) Forecasts (Previsiones)**
  - Produce short‑term forecasts using **SARIMAX** for:
    - GDP growth
    - Unemployment rate

- **7) Indicators table (Cuadro de indicadores)**
  - Include a summary table with the latest readings of the main indicators.
  - Present Spain as a benchmark in charts/tables when relevant.

### Deliverables
- A final **PDF report** (maximum 8 single‑sided A4 pages).
- A separate **methodology annex** describing the forecasting approach (and the synthetic consumption indicator only if Option A was used; not applicable here).
